  - Eliminates TypeScript warning about unused variable
  - Improves code cleanliness and maintainability

## [v1.1.0] - Integration Validation & Performance Utilities Enhancement

### Added
- **Integration Validation Script**: New `validate-integration.js` for comprehensive project health checks
  - Validates all required files are present in the project structure
  - Checks main component structure for essential patterns (React imports, error boundaries, accessibility)
  - Verifies package.json dependencies (lucide-react, TypeScript types)
  - Validates TypeScript configuration (jsx, strict mode, esModuleInterop)
  - Checks CSS integration (Tailwind imports, animations, responsive design)
  - Provides detailed integration summary with actionable next steps
  - Useful for CI/CD pipelines, onboarding, and pre-deployment validation

- **Improved TypeScript Support**: Enhanced `utils/performance.ts` with better type definitions
  - Added `DependencyList` type alias for better TypeScript compatibility
  - Replaced `React.DependencyList` with custom `DependencyList` type to avoid React namespace dependency
  - Improved type safety for all performance optimization hooks

### Performance Utilities Features
- **useStableReference**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders with stable object references

- **useThrottle**: Function execution throttling for performance-critical operations
- **useOptimizedCalculation**: Advanced calculation caching with performance monitoring
- **useAdvancedCache**: TTL-based caching with LRU eviction and statistics
- **useRenderOptimization**: Prevents unnecessary component re-renders
- **usePerformanceMonitor**: Development-time performance measurement
- **useIntersectionObserver**: Lazy loading optimization hook

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced TypeScript compatibility by removing React namespace dependency
- Improved type definitions for better IDE support and error detection
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation for all utility functions
