# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a forex calculator that compares traditional currency exchange rates with Bitcoin-based exchange rates. Users can see how much value they would get when exchanging currencies through Bitcoin versus traditional forex markets. The calculator fetches real-time Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko API and traditional forex rates from a free forex API to provide accurate comparisons.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to compare traditional forex rates with Bitcoin-based exchange rates, so that I can identify arbitrage opportunities and make informed trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a source currency and target currency THEN the system SHALL display both traditional forex rate and Bitcoin-based exchange rate
2. WHEN the user enters an amount to convert THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the converted amounts using both methods
3. WHEN the rates are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the percentage difference between traditional and Bitcoin-based rates
4. IF the Bitcoin-based rate is more favorable THEN the system SHALL highlight this with a visual indicator

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time exchange rates, so that I can make decisions based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator loads THEN the system SHALL fetch current Bitcoin prices from CoinGecko API
2. WHEN the calculator loads THEN the system SHALL fetch current forex rates from a free forex API
3. WHEN data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
4. IF API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
5. WHEN rates are successfully fetched THEN the system SHALL display the last updated timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from multiple currency pairs, so that I can compare rates for different international transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens currency selection THEN the system SHALL display a list of supported currencies
2. WHEN the user selects a currency pair THEN the system SHALL automatically update the rate calculations
3. WHEN displaying currencies THEN the system SHALL show both currency codes and full names
4. WHEN a currency pair is selected THEN the system SHALL support bidirectional conversion (A to B and B to A)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the calculation breakdown, so that I can understand how the Bitcoin-based rate is derived.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying Bitcoin-based rates THEN the system SHALL show the calculation steps (source currency to BTC, then BTC to target currency)
2. WHEN showing calculations THEN the system SHALL display individual Bitcoin prices for each currency
3. WHEN calculations are shown THEN the system SHALL include any applicable fees or spreads in the comparison
4. IF the user requests details THEN the system SHALL show the formula used for Bitcoin-based conversion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can use the calculator on different devices efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calculator is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN the user interacts with input fields THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and validation
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL use clear visual hierarchy and readable formatting
